# 🧠 ALL About AIML

Welcome to **ALL About AIML** — a comprehensive, hands-on repository covering the entire journey from **foundational AI/ML concepts** to **advanced deep learning implementations**, including the **Transformer architecture from scratch**.

## 🔥 Why This Repo?

This is more than just a code dump — it's a **structured learning + implementation track** designed to help you (and others) build real understanding and coding fluency in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## 📝 Learning Plan Behind This Repo

This repo follows a **2-week structured learning path** (see `Two-Week Learning and Implementation Plan.pdf`) covering:

- Week 1: ML Fundamentals → Deep Learning → Transformer Theory
- Week 2: Transformer from scratch → NLP Applications → Deployment & System Design

📄 See the `pdf` for day-wise breakdown and implementation goals.
